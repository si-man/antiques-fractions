				<p><strong>5.&nbsp;</strong> <strong>Our business relationship</strong></p>
				<p>a.&nbsp;
					If you become a Member, you acknowledge that you have done so in order
					to benefit from our system of trading in maturing cask Whisky. This
					means that you wish to own cask Whisky to profit from its increase in
					value over the course of its maturation.</p>
				<p>b.&nbsp;
					You also acknowledge that there is no guarantee that the price of the
					cask Whisky will rise over time and you accept the risk that the value
					could decrease in certain circumstances. The decision of when to sell a
					Cask is entirely at our discretion and we will not be responsible for
					any decrease in value.</p>
				<p>c.&nbsp;
					You understand that it is your responsibly to assess the value of the
					Whisky that you buy. None of the information provided on our Website is
					intended to amount to advice or guidance on your buying decisions and
					you should not rely on this information. We accept no responsibility for
					your decisions. &nbsp;</p>

					<div class="col-2 text-right">
						<p>i</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-10">
						<p>Cask Fractions are defined in
							clause 1 of these Terms. If you purchase a Cask Fraction, you purchase a
							percentage of the Whisky in a Cask. The number of Cask Fractions, and

							depending on the value of the particular cask.</p>

							Fraction, you own that Cask Fraction. When we sell the Cask that
							contains your Cask Fraction we retain the Management Fee on the sale of
							each Cask Fraction. You will then receive your money back together with
							the remainder of any profit. If the sale of a Cask makes a loss, you
							will receive back a percentage of the sale price equal to the percentage
							of the Whisky in the cask that your Cask Fraction represents but we
							will not retain the Management Fee in this instance. If you wish to
							trade your Cask Fraction with another Member we will charge you the
							Management Fee for the sale of each Cask Fraction.</p>

				<p><strong>9.&nbsp;</strong> <strong>Cancellation, refunds and returns</strong></p>

				<p><strong>Your consumer rights</strong></p>
				<p>If you are a consumer and have made a purchase via our Website, you will generally be entitled to a statutory 14-day cancellation period (the <strong>Cooling-off Period</strong>), during which time you can change your mind and receive a full
					refund. However, please note that the length of the Cooling-off Period and whether or not it applies differs depending on what you have purchased. Your statutory cancellation rights are described in more detail below.</p>
				<p>Please note that nothing in these terms restricts your rights under general consumer law, for example if we have broken the contract, or if we have misdescribed our goods or services.</p>

				<p> <strong>Membership</strong> </p>
				<p>a.&nbsp;
					We will only activate your Membership during the Cooling-off Period if
					you ask us to provide the Membership services right away by ticking the
					request box during the online checkout process.</p>

				<p>b.&nbsp;
					If you have asked us to activate your Membership right away, we will
					grant you immediate access to the full Members' benefits on the Website
					as soon as payment has been taken and you have completed the account
					registration process.</p>

				<p>c.&nbsp;
					Please note, however, that once we have provided the Membership
					services in full by granting you unrestricted access to the Members'
					benefits, you will lose the right to cancel your Membership during the
					Cooling-off Period and your Membership fee will not be refunded.</p>

				<p> <strong>Purchase of Cask Fraction</strong> </p>

				<p>d.&nbsp;
					If you purchase a Cask Fraction from us on our Website, you will have
					14 days starting from the date of the transaction to change your mind
					and receive a full refund of the amount you paid for the Cask Fraction.</p>

				<p>e.&nbsp;
					If you wish to exercise your right to cancel during this Cooling-off
					Period, all you have to do is contact us at [insert contact details] and
					let us know that you wish to cancel and receive a full refund. We will
					refund your payment within 14 days using the same payment method that
					you used to pay for the Cask Fraction.</p>

				<p>f.&nbsp;
					Please note that once the Cooling-off Period has expired, you will lose
					the right to cancel and receive a refund for the Cask Fraction. After
					this point, no refunds will be provided.</p>

				<p>g.&nbsp;
					For the avoidance of doubt, the cancellation rights described above do
					not apply to Member-to-Member sales of Cask Fractions. If you have
					purchased a Cask Fraction from another Member, we will not reimburse you
					in any circumstances.</p>

				<p> <strong>Withdrawing your Cask Fraction</strong> </p>

				<p>h.&nbsp;
					If you pay to withdraw your Cask Fraction on our Website, you will have
					14 days starting from the date of the transaction to change your mind
					and receive a full refund of the amount you paid to withdraw the Cask
					Fraction. No refunds will be provided once this Cooling-off Period has
					expired.</p>

				<p>i.&nbsp;
					Please note that you will not be permitted to withdraw your Cask
					Fraction during the Cooling-off Period.</p>

				<p> <strong>Bottles of whisky</strong> </p>

				<p>j.&nbsp;
					After purchasing a bottle of whisky from our website, you will have 14
					days starting from the date you receive the item to cancel the order and
					receive a full refund.</p>

				<p>k.&nbsp;
					If you wish to exercise your right to cancel during this Cooling-off
					Period, just let us know by contacting us at [insert contact details].
					You must post the item(s) back to us at [insert address] within 14 days
					of telling us you wish to end the contract. We will provide a full
					refund within 14 days of receiving your returned item(s) in the post
					using the same payment method that you used to pay. This will also
					include a refund of any basic (but not premium) delivery costs you paid
					at the point of sale. We will not refund the cost of returning the
					item(s) to us.</p>

				<p>l.&nbsp;
					Please note that, for health and hygiene purposes, you will lose the
					right to cancel the contract and receive a refund during the Cooling-off
					Period if you open the bottle of whisky after delivery. We may also
					apply a fair deduction to the refund if you have damaged the bottle
					while it is in under your control.</p>

				<p>m.&nbsp; Once
					the Cooling-off Period described above has expired, you will no longer
					be entitled to change your mind and receive a refund in relation to
					bottles of whisky. If, however, the product does not match the
					description, or if it is not of satisfactory quality, please let us know
					by contacting us at [insert contact details]. You may be entitled to a
					refund or replacement. Please note that we will only provide refunds in
					cases where there is a genuine product defect or quality issue.</p>
