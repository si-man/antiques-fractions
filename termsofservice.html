      <p>a.&nbsp;
        If you become a Member, you acknowledge that you have done so in order
        to benefit from our system of trading in maturing Antique Whisky. This
        means that you wish to own Antique Whisky to profit from its increase in
        value over the course of its maturation.</p>
      <p>b.&nbsp;
        You also acknowledge that there is no guarantee that the price of the
        Antique Whisky will rise over time and you accept the risk that the value
        could decrease in certain circumstances. The decision of when to sell a
        Antique is entirely at our discretion and we will not be responsible for
        any decrease in value.</p>
      <p>c.&nbsp;
        You understand that it is your responsibly to assess the value of the
        Whisky that you buy. None of the information provided on our Website is
        intended to amount to advice or guidance on your buying decisions and
        you should not rely on this information. We accept no responsibility for
        your decisions. &nbsp;</p>

        <div class="col-10">
          <p>Antique Fractions are defined in
            clause 1 of these Terms. If you purchase a Antique Fraction, you purchase a
            percentage of the Whisky in a Antique. The number of Antique Fractions, and
            therefore the percentage that a Antique Fraction represents, will vary
            depending on the value of the particular Antique.</p>

        <div class="col-10">
          <p>Each Antique Fraction is sold to
            you at a £20&nbsp;(Sterling) starting value. When you pay for a Antique
            Fraction, you own that Antique Fraction. When we sell the Antique that
            contains your Antique Fraction we retain the Management Fee on the sale of
            each Antique Fraction. You will then receive your money back together with
            the remainder of any profit. If the sale of a Antique makes a loss, you
            will receive back a percentage of the sale price equal to the percentage
            of the Whisky in the Antique that your Antique Fraction represents but we
            will not retain the Management Fee in this instance. If you wish to
            trade your Antique Fraction with another Member we will charge you the
            Management Fee for the sale of each Antique Fraction.</p>

      <p><strong>Your consumer rights</strong></p>
      <p>If you are a consumer and have made a purchase via our Website, you will generally be entitled to a statutory 14-day cancellation period (the <strong>Cooling-off Period</strong>), during which time you can change your mind and receive a
        full
        refund. However, please note that the length of the Cooling-off Period and whether or not it applies differs depending on what you have purchased. Your statutory cancellation rights are described in more detail below.</p>
      <p>Please note that nothing in these terms restricts your rights under general consumer law, for example if we have broken the contract, or if we have misdescribed our goods or services.</p>

      <p> <strong>Membership</strong> </p>
      <p>a.&nbsp;
        We will only activate your Membership during the Cooling-off Period if
        you ask us to provide the Membership services right away by ticking the
        request box during the online checkout process.</p>

      <p>b.&nbsp;
        If you have asked us to activate your Membership right away, we will
        grant you immediate access to the full Members' benefits on the Website
        as soon as payment has been taken and you have completed the account
        registration process.</p>

      <p>c.&nbsp;
        Please note, however, that once we have provided the Membership
        services in full by granting you unrestricted access to the Members'
        benefits, you will lose the right to cancel your Membership during the
        Cooling-off Period and your Membership fee will not be refunded.</p>

      <p> <strong>Purchase of Antique Fraction</strong> </p>

      <p>d.&nbsp;
        If you purchase a Antique Fraction from us on our Website, you will have
        14 days starting from the date of the transaction to change your mind
        and receive a full refund of the amount you paid for the Antique Fraction.</p>

      <p>e.&nbsp;
        If you wish to exercise your right to cancel during this Cooling-off
        Period, all you have to do is contact us at [insert contact details] and
        let us know that you wish to cancel and receive a full refund. We will
        refund your payment within 14 days using the same payment method that
        you used to pay for the Antique Fraction.</p>

      <p>f.&nbsp;
        Please note that once the Cooling-off Period has expired, you will lose
        the right to cancel and receive a refund for the Antique Fraction. After
        this point, no refunds will be provided.</p>

      <p>g.&nbsp;
        For the avoidance of doubt, the cancellation rights described above do
        not apply to Member-to-Member sales of Antique Fractions. If you have
        purchased a Antique Fraction from another Member, we will not reimburse you
        in any circumstances.</p>

      <p> <strong>Withdrawing your Antique Fraction</strong> </p>

      <p>h.&nbsp;
        If you pay to withdraw your Antique Fraction on our Website, you will have
        14 days starting from the date of the transaction to change your mind
        and receive a full refund of the amount you paid to withdraw the Antique
        Fraction. No refunds will be provided once this Cooling-off Period has
        expired.</p>

      <p>i.&nbsp;
        Please note that you will not be permitted to withdraw your Antique
        Fraction during the Cooling-off Period.</p>

      <p> <strong>Bottles of whisky</strong> </p>

      <p>j.&nbsp;
        After purchasing a bottle of whisky from our website, you will have 14

        If you wish to exercise your right to cancel during this Cooling-off

        You must post the item(s) back to us at [insert address] within 14 days
        of telling us you wish to end the contract. We will provide a full
        refund within 14 days of receiving your returned item(s) in the post
        using the same payment method that you used to pay. This will also
        include a refund of any basic (but not premium) delivery costs you paid
        at the point of sale. We will not refund the cost of returning the
        item(s) to us.</p>

      <p>l.&nbsp;
        Please note that, for health and hygiene purposes, you will lose the
        right to cancel the contract and receive a refund during the Cooling-off
        Period if you open the bottle of whisky after delivery. We may also
        apply a fair deduction to the refund if you have damaged the bottle
        while it is in under your control.</p>

      <p>m.&nbsp; Once
        the Cooling-off Period described above has expired, you will no longer
        be entitled to change your mind and receive a refund in relation to

      <p><strong>10.&nbsp;</strong> <strong>Delivery</strong></p>
      <p>a.&nbsp;
        If you purchase a Product, the costs of delivery will be displayed to
        you on our Website when you do so. We will give you an estimated
        delivery date when we confirm receipt of your order.</p>
      <p>b.&nbsp; Delivery of an order shall be completed when:</p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-2 text-right">
          <p>i</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-10">
          <p>our carrier delivers the
            Product; or</p>
        </div>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-2 text-right">
          <p>ii</p>

        <div class="col-10">
          <p>you (or someone else on your
            behalf) collect(s) the Product from us or from our carrier,</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
        and the Product will be your responsibility from that time. If you
        are informed about a failed delivery attempt but do not re-arrange
        delivery of a Product or collect that Product from the carrier’s depot
        we (or the carrier) will contact you for further instructions and we may
        charge you for storage costs and any further delivery costs. If,
        despite our reasonable efforts, we are unable to contact you or
        re-arrange delivery or collection we may charge you reasonable
        compensation for the net costs which we incur. We may deduct that
        compensation from the bank account which you used to pay for the
        Product. We may make that deduction from that bank account in more than
        one payment.</p>
      <p>c.&nbsp;
        You own the Products once we have received payment in full, including
        all applicable delivery charges, value added taxes, import duties,
        administration charges and taxes which are payable by us.</p>
      <p>d.&nbsp;
        We deliver to all countries listed on the Website, subject to the
        applicable delivery charges notified to you prior to completion of your
        purchase of a Product. You will be responsible for payment of import
        duties, taxes and charges on any international deliveries.</p>
